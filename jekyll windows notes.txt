using video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc&index=3&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB
(third video in a long playlist, 1st was "what is jekyll" and second was for mac os so i skipped it


first thing is the "ruby gems package manager"

I downloaded the "without devkit" edition, 2.5.1-1 x64
https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

the video says to let it associate rb and rbw extensions so i'll let it

console window opens after installing it
video says to install all three in order
run 1 and uncheck "run msys2 64bit now" - okay that's proably obvious
i'm doing on this guest wifi on my toughbook so it ended up taking a while...
3:00 min in


run 2
updates all the ruby related packages
apparently this is installing linux/unix libraries and pacman/bash/mintty etc on to system

run 3
mingw etc development toolchain

open cmd prompt
--> confirm everything is working correctly
ruby -v confirms rub is installed and prints version
gem -v does same for gem installed/version printout

next:
gem install jekyll bundler 
[I changed to my local drive repo to run this command, not sure if that was necessary: 
no additional files in that folder so not necessary]

should say "2 gems installed" -- actually it came 26 gems installed. maybe i just misheard that.

jekyll -v should print out something like:
jekyll 3.6.0 [v3.8.5 in my case. it has been 18 months since the video]

------------------------------------------------------

tutorial part 4 for video series above
this is how to 

jekyll new [name of site]
e.g.
jekyll new my-new-blog

creates a bunch default files or "scaffolding"
for this part:
ended up creating repo on github first called "jekyll-windows-test"
then cloning that to local drive in my repo folder - this is an empty folder with just .git subfolder 
and a readme.md file
then at CMD shell one level up/in repo folder ran the command with "--force" to make it create the 
scaffholding in this existing repo folder
"jekyll new jekyll-windows-test --force"
the --force is to make it work into a non-empty folder
and it did work as far as i can tell




bundle exec jekyll serve
for first time running it
after that just 
"jekyll serve"
can see site at localhost:4000
this worked exactly as described
just a web server with a "ctrl+c to stop server" message

in directory structure
there is _posts folder
also
_site
which seems to be the "root" of the site - finished/final version

_config.yml file - the settigns for jekyll web site
atrributes for site
also "gemfile" - used to store depencies for site
the "minima" is a reference to default theme
can also specify plugins etc

------------------------------------------------------

tutorial part 5 for video series above

"front matter" in jekyll

contains information about pages
like title or date written
information about each of pages

for instance:
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
date:   2019-02-21 20:45:05 -0800
categories: jekyll update
---
in the .markdown file
can be used to get information etc.

------------------------------------------------------

tutorial part 6 for video series above

this part 6 convers create blog posts in the _posts folder
the naming convention comes int he form:
2019-02-21-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown
can also just use .html instead of markdown - either works
the most important part is including the date at the front then the title for the rest of the title
and apparently both .md and .markdown work for extensions
I find out by experimenting that setting the file to a future date doesn't auto-show up. 
Although perhaps it would eventually show up on the main page as an entry

the first step for any new post file should be adding the "front matter" inside those three dashes ---
above/below it
I gather this is a lot like meta data only it matters quite a lot to tell jekyll how to display the content
layout: post
is for posts - custom layouts can be created/used though
The 
title:
front matter over rides the title of the entry. By default it would use the info from the file's name
for instance the file
2019-02-22-first-example-blogpost.md
would show up with the title "First Example Blogpost"
without that title: entry
while 
title:  "Welcome to my newest blog"
would change the title to "Welcome to my newest blog"
These are "front matter variables"

subfolders can be created under the _posts folder

------------------------------------------------------

tutorial part 7

all about "drafts"

create a "_drafts" folder - same level as the _posts folder

any md file in that _drafts folder will be a work in progress
won't show up directly in "posts" section of page
to see these pages use the alt jekyl server command:

jekyll server --draft
